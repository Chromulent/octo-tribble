# This is an Example of output with two specified directories

fdupes -rd /mnt/OpenDrive/Videos/YouTube/ /mnt/OpenDrive/Videos/Creators/

[1] /mnt/OpenDrive/Videos/YouTube/ShoeOnhead/nice guysâ„¢ finish last.webm
[2] /mnt/OpenDrive/Videos/Creators/ShoeOnhead/nice guystm finish last.webm


# The first directory will be option [1] during the selection of removal during de-duplication.
# Unless, multiple items in the same directory exist with the same hash to be removed.

fdupes -rd /dir1 /dir2


# So using the above we can conclude then, that we if we use this example:
# Then all content within /dir2 will be deleted if it exists in /dir1
# with no confirmation.

fdupes -rdN /dir1 /dir2
