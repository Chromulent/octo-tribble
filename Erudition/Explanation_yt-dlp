CONFIGURATION


You can configure yt-dlp by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file. The configuration is loaded from the following locations:

Main Configuration: The file given by --config-location

Portable Configuration: yt-dlp.conf in the same directory as the bundled binary. If you are running from source-code (<root dir>/yt_dlp/__main__.py), the root directory is used instead.

Home Configuration: 	yt-dlp.conf in the home path given by -P, or in the current directory if no such path is given

User Configuration:   	%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%/yt-dlp/config (recommended on Linux/macOS)

System Configuration: 	/etc/yt-dlp.conf


For example, with the following configuration file yt-dlp will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under YouTube directory in your home directory:

# Lines starting with # are comments

# Always extract audio
-x

# Do not copy the mtime
--no-mtime

# Use this proxy
--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

# Save all videos under YouTube directory in your home directory
-o ~/YouTube/%(title)s.%(ext)s
