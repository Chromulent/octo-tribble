-I, --playlist-items ITEM_SPEC  Comma separated playlist_index of the videos
                                to download. You can specify a range using
                                "[START]:[STOP][:STEP]". For backward
                                compatibility, START-STOP is also supported.
                                Use negative indices to count from the right
                                and negative STEP to download in reverse
                                order. Eg: "-I 1:3,7,-5::2" used on a
                                playlist of size 15 will download the videos
                                at index 1,2,3,7,11,13,15

--match-filters FILTER          Generic video filter. Any "OUTPUT TEMPLATE"
                                field can be compared with a number or a
                                string using the operators defined in
                                "Filtering Formats". You can also simply
                                specify a field to match if the field is
                                present, use "!field" to check if the field
                                is not present, and "&" to check multiple
                                conditions. Use a "\" to escape "&" or
                                quotes if needed. If used multiple times,
                                the filter matches if atleast one of the
                                conditions are met. Eg: --match-filter
                                !is_live --match-filter "like_count>?100 &
                                description~='(?i)\bcats \& dogs\b'" matches
                                only videos that are not live OR those that
                                have a like count more than 100 (or the like
                                field is not available) and also has a
                                description that contains the phrase "cats &
                                dogs" (caseless). Use "--match-filter -" to
                                interactively ask whether to download each
