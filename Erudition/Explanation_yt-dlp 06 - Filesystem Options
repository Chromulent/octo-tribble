Explanation_yt-dlp 06 - Filesystem Options

-a, --batch-file FILE           File containing URLs to download ("-" for
                                stdin), one URL per line. Lines starting
                                with "#", ";" or "]" are considered as
                                comments and ignored
--no-batch-file                 Do not read URLs from batch file (default)
-P, --paths [TYPES:]PATH        The paths where the files should be
                                downloaded. Specify the type of file and the
                                path separated by a colon ":". All the same
                                TYPES as --output are supported.
                                Additionally, you can also provide "home"
                                (default) and "temp" paths. All intermediary
                                files are first downloaded to the temp path
                                and then the final files are moved over to
                                the home path after download is finished.
                                This option is ignored if --output is an
                                absolute path

                                extension) to the specified number of
