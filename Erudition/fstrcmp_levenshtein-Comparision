  The fstrcmp command understands the following options:

       -a

       --files-as-bytes
               This  option  is used to compare two files as arrays of bytes.  See fmemcmp(3) for
               more information.

       -p

       --pair  This option is used to compare two strings  as  arrays  of  bytes.   This  is  the
               default.  See fstrcmp(3) for more information.

       -s

       --select
               This  option  is  used  to  select  the  closest needle from the provided haystack
               alternatives.   The  most  similar  (single)  choice  is  printed.   If  none  are
               particularly  similar,  nothing  is printed.  See fstrcmp(3) for more information.
               See below for example.

       -V

       --version
               This option may be used to print the version of  the  fstrcmp  command,  and  then
               exit.

       -w

       --wide-pair
               This  option is used to compare two multi‚Äêbyte character strings.  See fstrcoll(3)
               for more information.
