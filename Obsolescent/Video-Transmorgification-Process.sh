# Later daniel Note: if this is used, you might be able to dynamicially add or remove which functions can be called on by either defining them, 
# or by a simple bashing out of those that are not needed.

## Either way, this method can DRAMATICALLY simplify all work done as all work will become unified under this thought process instead of 
### manual commands done with no check on its own reduducnancy and does not rely on human memory.



# Store the remote calls here and store transmorgification commands as functions conv_to_()

# store file type array here, .ts, avi, m4v, mkv, etc..

# Look at Video Report function, but instead of reporting we will run the process itself. 



# If .EXT is not .WEBM then --> Content pair with remote call function to run said command against. 

### delete previous array here
### define new array here

## spefically if .EXT is not .WEBM then store all of .EXT file type within array - gather FULL PATH name

## for each item within this defined array, do the following: 


# using remote call functions of transmorgification create a switch like powershell object (or find how to use or mimic) based on extension that is defined.
## if .EXT is .EXT then do convert .EXT to Y
## if .EXT1 is .EXT1 then do convert .EXT1 to Z

#####   Finish array
##      Loop array for all file types if they exist


# run if_smol_del here against the root array

# get all file types for all folders in all root directories. 

### if not those defined in the file type array then do not add to the dedupe array


## if_new_del_old -- if new kind of file type exists here, then we can del the old. (only for those within the array)







# If NOT WEBM then move to failed conversion folder (will define)




# IF WEBM then move full name to new path based on root folder to move all files except for tv files, these need to have an exception created for them to
move them and their directories to the proper location.
